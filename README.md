Building a basic Bank Management System software using JAVA to deal with all the bank accounts and transactions in a bank. The proposed system is a web-based project that digitally simulates how a bank works.

A basic Bank Management System application needs to have the following features:

•	Three login portals - for Bank customers, Bank employees and the Admin. The customers will enter all their personal details while registering themselves into the system. The Bank employees can login themselves by entering their details like, employee id, name and position. The admin login should be able to view the profiles of both customers and employees.

•	The Bank customers should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as they desire.

•	There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdrawals if the balance is sufficient. There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.
